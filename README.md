# Quantitative Finance Lab 🧪

Welcome to **Quantitative Finance Lab**. This repository serves as the code companion for my YouTube channel, where I apply **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Financial Engineering** concepts to real-world market data.

My goal is to bridge the gap between academic theory (MBA/Quant curriculums) and practical application using Python.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
The projects in this repository primarily rely on the Python scientific stack:
*   **Data:** `yfinance`, `pandas`, `numpy`
*   **Visualization:** `plotly`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
*   **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am an AI/ML engineer with a PhD in engineering from UIUC, and currently pursuing an MBA at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. This channel is my playground for applying advanced quantitative methods to everyday financial questions.
